# Steganography_Project

An attempt at a simple steganography program for my Programming for IT class. The idea for this program is that it will be able to import an image from the user's computer or clipboard, then hide a text file within the image. It is important to note that I will be using the least significant bit method of steganography, and not just appending data to the image. If I am able to successfully complete this, then I will move on to hiding another image within the image, and possibly other file types.
